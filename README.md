CS 174A Fall 2020 Final Project.

Members: Justin Aoki, Ivana Chang, Zachary McNelley.

Idea: Our project simulates the passage of time by showing grass growing on a brick house. We used bump mapping to make the brick house look realistic and a texture lerp to allow the grass to begin growing from the deepest cracks in the brick and slowly expand outwards. The user can press play/pause to animate the scene and watch as the time moves forward and backward. The stars, made with particle effects, rotate in the night sky to contribute to the passage of time. The user can also pause the scene and view any particular moment in time with the Time buttons. The user can play with the rate at which the time passes with the Speed buttons. Lastly, the user can control the lighting of the brick house to see the effects of the bump map with the Brick Lighting buttons.

Advanced Features:
1. Normal/Bump Mapping
2. Texture Lerp/Height Mapping
3. Particle Effects
